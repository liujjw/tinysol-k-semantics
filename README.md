# How to run
Tested on version 5.0.0 of the K-framework tool from https://github.com/kframework/k/releases on WSL Ubuntu Bionic.

`kompile tinysol-oo.k` to compile. Then, for example, type `krun tests/d1.k` to run the demo files. 

The result of execution will be any log statements executed (at the beginning of the output) and a dump of nested angle brackets representing the final state of the configuration. 

Check `demo.md` for more details.
